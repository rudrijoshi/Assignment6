# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This Weather Dashboard is a user-friendly web application designed for travelers who
want to stay informed about the weather outlook for multiple cities. Whether you're
planning a weekend getaway or an extended vacation, this dashboard provides you with
essential weather information to help you make informed travel decisions

## User Story

As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan my trip accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

To meet the needs of our users, we have implemented the following features in our Weather Dashboard:

1. Weather Search

* When you visit the dashboard, you'll find a user-friendly form input to search for a city.
* Upon entering a city and initiating a search:
 * You will be presented with both current and future weather conditions for that city.
 * The searched city will be added to your search history for easy access.

2. Current Weather Conditions

* When viewing current weather conditions for a city, you will see:
 * The city name
 * The date
 * An icon representation of current weather conditions
 * The temperature
 * The humidity
 * The wind speed

3. Future Weather Conditions

* For your convenience, a 5-day weather forecast is displayed for the city you searched for.
* Each forecast includes:
 * The date
 * An icon representation of weather conditions
 * The temperature
 * The wind speed
 * The humidity

4. Search History

* In case you want to revisit the weather details of a previously searched city, you can click on that city's name in the search history.
* Clicking on a city in the search history will again present you with both current and future weather conditions for that city.

## How to Use

* Visit the Weather Dashboard website.
* In the provided form input, enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for.
* Click the "Search" button to retrieve weather information.
* Explore the current and future weather conditions for the selected city.

I referenced the tutorials available on https://www.w3schools.com/ to seek guidance and assistance, tapping into their
wealth of knowledge to enhance the quality and precision of my project.

We are continuously working on improving the Weather Dashboard and plan to implement
the following features in the future:

* Unit selection (e.g., Fahrenheit vs. Celsius)
* Geolocation support for current location weather
